These are the complete development and handin files from one of my 4th year projects. 

The assignment brief is provided in the 'Context' subdirectory.
The first pass code for the AT-Mega 32u4 is in the 'Microcontroller Code' subdirectory.
The first pass QT UI code is in the 'PC Control Code' subdirectory.
The PCB design files are in the 'PCB Files' subdirectory. They were designed in Ki-Cad.

The final report, written between me and another student, Josh Baynes, is listed as 'Stepper and Control Report Jesse Taylor Josh Baynes'

In summary, we were asked to design a full mechatronic system for a 1-D stepper motor linear actuator, and write microcontroller and PC support software.
The code ended up pretty basic, and the microcontroller code was pretty dependent on third party libraries, linked below.
